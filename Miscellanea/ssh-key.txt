1. First generate private key (restricted, kept locally only) and public key (.pub, kept publicly on a Bitbucket or GitHub server):
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "yourname@email.com"

- ssh-keygen alone would generate an RSA key which is deprecated,
- that's why type -t ed25519 to use better encrypting algorithm,
- optionally we can type -b 256 to use 256-byte algorithm,

2. The terminal output is: 
"Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/llebioda/.ssh/id_ed25519):"

- now (optionally) change path (/Users/llebioda/.ssh/) or file name (id_ed25519) ,
- or hit enter to accept default values,
- passphrase is optional.

3. Now we can list keys in our .ssh directory:
ls -l ~/.ssh

4. And read the file with the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

6. Copy the content of the file into Bitbucket / GitHub etc.:
exapmple of the content: 
"ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIAw3ml60+tnwfDsRbd9JWxT++/EIF65rJ/8cWizNKmEx my@email.com"
